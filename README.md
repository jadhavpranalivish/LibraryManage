The Library Management System is designed to manage library books efficiently using cpp programming, Data Structures, and File Handling.
It provides easy operations for librarians and users to add, search, update, delete, and analyze books while storing data persistently.
This console-based project uses linked lists and templates to store book records dynamically and file handling to save data permanently.
